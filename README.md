# Customer-Retention
The telecom's Retention Manager has requested a Power BI dashboard to proactively identify at-risk customers before they terminate contracts rather than post-termination. The dashboard will use provided resources to create clear, intuitive visualizations of customer data, aiding in strategic retention efforts and enhancing management insight.

**Explanation of the Churn Dashboard and Risk Analysis Dashboard**

**Churn Dashboard**

   - **Customers at Risk:** 1,869
   - **Monthly Charges:** $139.13K
   - **Yearly Charges:** $2.86M

   - **Number of Admin Tickets:** 885

   These metrics provide a high-level overview of the current customer base's risk of churn and associated financial metrics.

2. **Demographics:**
   - **Gender Distribution:** Almost equal distribution with 49.76% female and 50.24% male.
   - **Senior Citizens:** 25%
   - **Partners:** 36%
   - **Dependents:** 17%

   These demographic details give insight into the composition of the customer base, which can help tailor retention strategies.

3. **Customer Account Information:**
   - **Payment Methods:** Majority use electronic checks (57%), followed by mailed checks (16%), bank transfers (14%), and credit cards (12%).
   - **Paperless Billing:** 74.91% of customers use paperless billing.

   - **Average Total Charges:** $1,531.80
   - **Type of Contract:** Predominantly month-to-month (89%), with fewer customers on one-year (9%) or two-year (3%) contracts.

   This section helps understand customer preferences and behavior in terms of billing and contract types, which are critical for identifying churn risks.

4. **Services Customers Signed Up For:**
   - The majority of customers have phone services (91%), with significant portions also subscribing to streaming services (movies and TV), device protection, online backup, tech support, and online security.

   This highlights the primary services driving customer retention and potential cross-selling opportunities.

**Risk Analysis Dashboard**

1. **Overall Churn Metrics:**
   - **Total Customers:** 7,043
   - **Churn Rate:** 26.54%
   - **Yearly Charges:** $16.06M
   - **Churn:** 1,869 customers

   This provides a snapshot of the customer base, overall churn rate, and financial implications of churn.

2. **Churn by Type of Internet Service:**
   - **Fiber Optic:** 41.89% churn rate, which is the highest among service types.
   - **DSL:** 18.96% churn rate.
   - **No Internet Service:** 7.40% churn rate.

   This breakdown helps identify which service types have higher churn rates, indicating areas needing attention.

3. **Number of Customers by Internet Services:**
   - Largest customer base uses fiber optic, followed by DSL and no internet service.

4. **Type of Contract:**
   - **Churn Rate by Contract Type:** Highest for month-to-month contracts.
   - **Count of Customers by Contract Type:** Most customers are on month-to-month contracts, followed by one-year and two-year contracts.

   This indicates that customers on shorter-term contracts are at higher risk of churn.

5. **Years of Contract:**
   - **Churn Rate by Contract Duration:** Higher churn rates for customers with less than one year of subscription.

   This suggests that new customers are more likely to churn, possibly due to unmet expectations or issues early in their service experience.

6. **Churn by Payment Method:**
   - **Highest Churn Rate:** Electronic check users.
   - **Lowest Churn Rate:** Credit card (automatic) users.

   Understanding payment method preferences can help in predicting churn risk and designing targeted retention strategies.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

Both dashboards together provide a comprehensive view of the current state of customer churn and its associated risks. The Churn Dashboard gives a detailed breakdown of the at-risk customers, their demographics, and service usage, while the Risk Analysis Dashboard offers insights into the overall customer base, highlighting key risk factors and trends in churn behavior.

For the **Retention Manager**, these dashboards will serve as valuable tools for:
- Identifying high-risk customer segments.
- Understanding key factors driving churn.
- Designing proactive retention strategies, such as offering incentives for long-term contracts, improving customer experience for new customers, and targeting specific demographics or service users with tailored offers.

By focusing on these areas, the retention department can shift from a reactive to a proactive approach, reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
